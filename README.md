# RunLuaSourceContainer (shortened, RunLSC)
This is a simple Roblox Studio plugin for running LuaSourceContainer(s) (excluding CoreScript instances), I wrote this because I could not find a feature where you can select multiple scripts and click a button to simulate running them.

## Building a rbxm plugin file
You must have [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) v7.x.x (tested: v7.2.1) installed and added to your path.
Run the following command:
```
rojo build default.project.json --output RunLSC.rbxm
```

## Limitations
- ~~If loadstring is not available, then it will fall back to using Yueliang + FiOne for code execution, otherwise it will use Robloxâ€™s provided loadstring.~~ No longer applicable if using any version newer than 1.2

## TODOs
- [x] Implement a way to load scripts and run them on the client natively (already found a way, just needs implementation)
- [x] Ability to run a script on the server while being on the client context and the way around
- [x] Settings manager
- [x] Settings widget
- [x] Built-in script executor for replacing command bar
